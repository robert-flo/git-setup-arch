Usage:
  tests/validate-release-archive.sh

Purpose:
  Check that PKGBUILD records a fixed SHA-256 checksum for the release archive,
  then ask makepkg to download and verify every source entry. The current source
  entries are the tagged GitHub release archive and the local launcher.

Container phases (see lib/container-verify-source.sh):
  1. Create an unprivileged builder account required by makepkg.
  2. Copy PKGBUILD and the launcher from the read-only mount to a writable area.
  3. Run `makepkg --verifysource` to download sources and compare their hashes.

Packages installed inside the container:
  None. archlinux:latest already provides makepkg, curl, and sha256sum.

What this script does not do:
  - It does not build or install the git-setup package.
  - It does not execute git-setup or its public commands.
  - It does not read GIT_SETUP_SOURCE_DIR or local source-checkout code.
  Use validate-local-install.sh for the installation and public-command checks.

Host impact:
  - No host or container packages are installed or upgraded.
  - No host HOME, Git configuration, SSH keys, or GPG keys are mounted.
  - The package repository is mounted read-only.
  - Docker may pull/cache archlinux:latest and use bandwidth and disk space.
  - `docker run --rm` deletes the container and downloaded archive on exit.

Network behavior:
  makepkg downloads the tagged GitHub archive declared by PKGBUILD. Failure to
  reach GitHub, a missing tag, or any checksum mismatch fails the validation.

Exit status:
  0  The release archive and launcher matched their fixed checksums.
  2  Usage, Docker access, or PKGBUILD metadata error.
  *  Docker, download, or checksum verification failed.
